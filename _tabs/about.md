**Hello! I'm Dawson, and welcome to my little corner of the internet.** 

I'm a full time professional nerd who enjoys designing over the top technological systems of all kinds for absolutely no reason. 

I got my start in tech by doing support and repair jobs for my High School's IT department. Upon graduating, I went to Indiana University where I learned the fundamentals of both hardware and software design.

While attending university, I had the amazing opportunity to help run the Digital Design and Fabrication Labs at the Luddy School. I met many incredibly creative and talented people - from artists to engineers - and help bring their ideas to life. Also, there's not many jobs where you get to help someone make a functional animatronic cheeseburger.

When I'm not working on hardware and software, I design 3D models, develop games, and climb walls of rocks.
