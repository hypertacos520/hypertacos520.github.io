My name's Dawson Thompson and I'm currently a graduate student in the Luddy School's Intelligent Systems Engineering program. I like to tinker with different technologies to learn more about them, and find new and interesting ways to use them.

Some of my hobbies are 3D design, game development, and rock climbing.
