You may have noticed that even though this website is new, it says there's posts from about 3 or so years ago. I'm currently working on going back and documenting a bunch of projects I've worked on and have set the date of each post to the last day I worked on each project. The last updated date will be the date it was actually posted. It might be a little confusing for now, but it will make sense in the long term.
